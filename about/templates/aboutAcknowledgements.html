<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
<p>This might look like an official SFU website, but it's not. The general look and feel was borrowed from a variety of SFU webpages in order to maintain the "common look and feel" as perscribed by the <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/clf/branding.html">SFU Branding Requirements</a>. The banner <a href="{{STATIC_PREFIX}}logo_main.gif">above</a> is from <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/content/sfu/www/siteconfig/jcr:content/main_content/bannerconfig/leftImage.img.png/1329748546945.png">here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, this project makes use of the <a href="https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/css/main.css">HTML5 Boilerplate CSS reset</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways, with that all said, thanks to the university for hopefully not suing us. Thanks also to our colleagues, friends and family, especially <a href="https://github.com/kevinmannn">Kevin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/derekfong">Derek</a> and <a href="https://github.com/allisonng">Allison</a> for fielding our questions, showing us what we should be doing, and (most importantly) feeding us.
<p>Also thanks to our <a href="http://www2.cs.sfu.ca/CourseCentral/470/apike/">CMPT 470</a> <a href="http://www.allenpike.com/">instructor</a> for not calling us crazy, even though we weren't sure if this was possible at the time. And thanks to <a href="http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ggbaker/">Greg Baker</a> for clueing us in as to where to find up-to-date semester data.</p>
<h1>Dependencies</h1>
<p>While the actual project you see is pretty small and self-contained, we were only able to get it as such by bringing in extra software.</p>
<p>That said, we've built this on top of <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.3/">Django 1.3.1</a>. We're making use of <a href="http://www.dajaxproject.com/">Dajax & Dajaxice</a> as well as <a href="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.2.js">jQuery 1.7.2</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-misc/blob/master/jquery.ba-serializeobject.min.js">jquery.ba-serializeobject</a>. The developers made use of the <a href="https://github.com/django-debug-toolbar/django-debug-toolbar">django-debug-toolbar</a>.</p>
