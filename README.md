CMPT 470 Project
================

Due: Around the end of November 2012

By: [Randy Tarampi](https://github.com/randytarampi), [Steven Evans](https://github.com/FaceBones) & [Conrad Locke](https://github.com/clocke)

We're supposedly making some sort of class schedule optimizer - it'll probably use Django and will be located at http://cmpt470.csil.sfu.ca:9017

Dependenices:
-------------

Requires [Dajax & Dajaxice](http://www.dajaxproject.com/).
Also requires [jQuery 1.7.2](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.2.js) and [jquery.ba-serializeobject](https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-misc/blob/master/jquery.ba-serializeobject.min.js).
Makes use of the [django-debug-toolbar](https://github.com/django-debug-toolbar/django-debug-toolbar).


This project uses the HTML5 Boilerplate CSS reset, which can be found [here](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/css/main.css).

Our CMPT 307 prof & textbook, without both of which we probably wouldn't have settled on (or even had) the idea.

Our CMPT 470 prof, who didn't call us crazy.

Our friends, families, colleagues and loved ones who will presumingly bear with our frustrations/ranting during the building process.
