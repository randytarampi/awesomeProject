CMPT 470 Project
================

Due: Around the end of November 2012

By: [Randy Tarampi](https://github.com/randytarampi), [Steven Evans](https://github.com/FaceBones) & [Conrad Locke](https://github.com/clocke)

We're supposedly making some sort of class schedule optimizer - it'll probably use Django and will be located at http://cmpt470.csil.sfu.ca:9017

Acknowledgements:
-----------------

Our CMPT 307 prof & textbook, without both of which we probably wouldn't have settled on (or even had) the idea.

Our CMPT 470 prof, who will hopefully approve of the idea.

Our friends (for [Randy](https://github.com/randytarampi), especially [Kevin](https://github.com/kevinmannn) and [Derek](https://github.com/derekfong)) and loved ones who will presumingly bear with our frustrations/ranting during the building process.
