CMPT 470 Project
================

Due: 5 December 2012 2358 PT.

By: [Randy Tarampi](https://github.com/randytarampi), [Steven Evans](https://github.com/FaceBones) & [Conrad Locke](https://github.com/clocke)

We're making some sort of class schedule optimizer - it uses Django and will be located at http://cmpt470.csil.sfu.ca:9017

Interested in what we had at our checkpoint evaluation? Check out the [checkpoint](https://github.com/randytarampi/awesomeProject/tree/checkpoint) tag.

To Do:
------

Lots! We need to do lots of testing and general beautifying. As far as we're concerned, this is a bit more than a proof of concept, but substantially less than a polished, final product.

That said, we to do lots of work on the algorithm. The general styling and setup of the actual "[app](http://cmpt470.csil.sfu.ca:9017/scheduler/)" shouldn't be too much work - we're thinking about doing a bit experimenting with it depending on what we think looks "best", by no means is what you see finalized.

Dependenices:
-------------

Requires [Dajax & Dajaxice](http://www.dajaxproject.com/).
Also requires [jQuery 1.7.2](http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.2.js) and [jquery.ba-serializeobject](https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-misc/blob/master/jquery.ba-serializeobject.min.js).
Makes use of the [django-debug-toolbar](https://github.com/django-debug-toolbar/django-debug-toolbar).

The arrow icons come from the [Mini icons 2](http://www.iconfinder.com/search/?q=iconset%3Aminiicons2) icon set. The loading spinner is care of [NETEYE](http://neteye.github.com/activity-indicator.html). The breadcrumb implementation comes care of [django-breadcrumbs](https://github.com/chronossc/django-breadcrumbs).

This project uses the HTML5 Boilerplate CSS reset, which can be found [here](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/css/main.css).

Our CMPT 307 prof & textbook, without both of which we probably wouldn't have settled on (or even had) the idea. Our CMPT 470 prof, who didn't call us crazy.

Our friends, families, colleagues and loved ones who will presumingly bear with our frustrations/ranting during the building process. A special mention goes out to [Allison](https://github.com/allisonng) who made us cookies.
